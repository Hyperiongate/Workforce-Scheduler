# utils/__init__.py
# This file makes the utils directory a Python package

"""
Utils Package for Workforce Scheduler

This package contains helper functions and utilities used throughout the application.
"""

# You can optionally import commonly used functions here for easier access
# from .helpers import get_coverage_gaps, get_overtime_opportunities

# For now, we'll keep it simple - just having this file is enough
# to make Python recognize 'utils' as a package
